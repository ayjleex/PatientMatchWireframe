# Patient Match wireframe

This is a wireframe for the PatientMatch webapp.
It uses the SB Admin 2 bootstrap template.

[SB Admin 2](https://startbootstrap.com/template-overviews/sb-admin-2/) is an open source admin dashboard theme for [Bootstrap](http://getbootstrap.com/) created by [Start Bootstrap](http://startbootstrap.com/).

For the legacy Bootstrap 3 version of this theme, you can view the [last stable release](https://github.com/BlackrockDigital/startbootstrap-sb-admin-2/releases/tag/v3.3.7%2B1) of SB Admin 2 for Bootstrap 3.


## Usage

After installation, run `npm install` and then run `npm start` which will open up a preview of the template in your default browser, watch for changes to core template files, and live reload the browser when changes are saved. You can view the `gulpfile.js` to see which tasks are included with the dev environment.
